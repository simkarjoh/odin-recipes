<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and a blend of cheeses. 
    To prepare it, start by cooking a hearty meat sauce with ground beef or sausage, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs. 
    In a separate pan, prepare a smooth béchamel sauce by whisking butter, flour, and milk until thickened.
    Begin assembling by spreading a layer of the meat sauce in a baking dish, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of béchamel, and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
    Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a final layer of sauce and cheese on top.
    Bake the lasagna in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, then let it rest for a few minutes before slicing into it. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil or parsley.
